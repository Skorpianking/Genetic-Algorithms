Hosts GA files
22 June 16:  Added three intial Python files. circle_finder and expression_finder each use a simple GA to find possible answers to a trivial problem.  expression_finder takes a user number as input and then derives a mathematical expression that equals that number.  Since I limited to a set number of generations, a solution may not be found.  circle_finder attempts to find the largest circle that can be possibly drawn among other circles.  The circles cannot overlap or intersect in any way.  Again, it is limited to a set number of generations, so the size of the circle found may not be the largest possible.  circle_class is just that, a simple circle class used by circle_finder.
